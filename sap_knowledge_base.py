SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition Overview

SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, is a ready-to-run cloud ERP that delivers the latest industry best practice business processes and continuous enhancements to help customers stay competitive and enable them to work toward their future business goals.

This solution tends to be the best fit for new customers with minimal customization requirements and an openness to adopting the predelivered SAP Best Practice business processes that are already available in the system. These processes are regularly improved with enhancements between releases, and in the major release upgrades that occur in August and February each year. Enhancements and upgrades are automatically installed by SAP on a defined release schedule.

SAP tries to make it as easy as possible for customers to manage and maintain their SAP S/4HANA Cloud systems during and after release upgrades by providing tools that enable them to get an understanding of the impact on their actual system (Release Assessment and Scope Dependency tool), and to re-test their upgraded processes after a release with automated scripts (Test Automation Tool).

Finance-led Administrative ERP

Every business needs to buy and sell things, and keep track of how much money is going out and coming in. These core tasks are covered in a set of business processes from the Finance, Sales, and Sourcing and Procurement LoBs referred to as Administrative ERP.

Procure to pay
In the Finance LoB, a business forecasts what they estimate they'll need to purchase for the upcoming quarters to determine how much budget to set aside. In the Sourcing and Procurement LoB, the business identifies what they need from suppliers, purchases the items (for example, laptops for new hire employees), pays the supplier, and receives the goods.

Order to cash
In the Sales LoB, we receive orders from our customers, confirm the orders, and deliver goods to customers. The payments received post in the Finance LoB to accounts receivable and our revenue adjusts accordingly. Back in the Sales LoB, if there's a customer return, we handle the return by inspecting the returned good, and hopefully can put it back in stock to sell to a future customer. If a customer submits a claim based on a product's warranty, we may need additional business processes in the Service LoB to create a service order and deliver the service described in the warranty.

Record to report
In the Finance LoB, we perform period end-closing at the end of each month. This is the last day of the period when the accounts are set back to a zero balance. Additional financial accounting tasks are completed to record transactions, reconcile bank statements, manage tax payments, and ensure the accuracy of all financial statements. Moving forward, we continue to plan for the future, maintain the budget, and forecast potential financial requirements based on different scenarios for the business.

Service-Centric Industries

In addition to the core processes covered in Administrative ERP, do we sell services to our customers? If we sell services, what type of services are being sold? Selling consulting services and delivering on those services is covered with the business processes in the Professional Services LoB. If we sell technical services, for example when a technician from your internet provider comes to our location to fix or replace a faulty modem, these are covered by business processes in the Service LoB. The example below is based on selling consulting services to a customer.

Sell and plan
Before a service is sold, there's likely some work being done in the Sales LoB to generate leads who will potentially buy our services.

Setup and staff
Once a consulting service is sold, we can set up the project with processes in the Professional Services LoB, search for people within our organization that have the right skills for the project tasks, and staff the project.

Deliver and recognize
To support the project, do we need to procure any services or materials from a third-party provider? If so, we move into the Sourcing and Procurement LoB to identify what we need, purchase it from a supplier, and pay the supplier. In the Professional Services LoB, we deliver each task of the project, and the staffed resources submit their time and expense reports for work-related travel. The project manager keeps track of the project margin (how much the customer is being charged less the cost of expenses and consultant time working on the project) to ensure it stays profitable as the customer pays installments of the total cost.

Bill and manage
After the project completes, the customer pays the final installment and the revenue is recognized through processes in the Finance LoB. The project manager uses the analytical applications to evaluate different aspects of the project.

Product-Centric Industries

In addition to the core processes covered in Administrative ERP, do we sell products to our customers? If we sell products, how much of the design, production, and delivery of the products are handled in-house? This brings in several other LoBs to handle the operational tasks necessary when a business produces products to sell.

We could produce pharmaceuticals or pre-made baking mixes through process manufacturing, or we could produce cars or mobile devices through discrete manufacturing. Process manufacturing is where ingredients are combined in a mixture, and once combined, cannot be separated back to the original parts. Discrete manufacturing is where materials are assembled into semi-finished or finished goods, and once assembled, can be separated back to the original parts. The example below is based on discrete manufacturing.

Idea to market
When developing a new product, a business starts with processes in the R&D Engineering LoB to forecast the demand for a potential product, and design the product itself. This creates the materials list needed to begin production, which is handed over to the Manufacturing LoB. We run material requirements planning to identify what we have or can make in-house, and what we have to order (procure) from third-party suppliers.

Procure to pay
In the Sourcing and Procurement LoB, we source materials from third-party suppliers, order and pay for the materials, and receive them into our warehouse.

Plan to fulfill
Now we can move forward in the Manufacturing LoB with scheduling and running the production process. We need to pick the materials from our warehouse necessary to make different parts of the final product (sub-assemblies), then run the final assembly to put all the pieces together into the finished good. We're likely using some expensive machinery to assemble our product, and those machines need to be maintained - maintaining our assets is covered by processes in the Asset Management LoB. The finished goods should go through a quality check, then be stored in our warehouse. The logistics of moving materials between our warehouses, locations, and plants is covered with warehouse management processes, which are under the umbrella of the Supply Chain LoB.

Order to cash
In the Sales LoB, we receive sales orders, whether we're selling direct to the consumer, through a third-party platform or both. We then move into the Supply Chain LoB to get the final product delivered to the customer by planning the transport of the outbound delivery from our warehouse to the final destination. The transportation of goods between warehouses or orchestrating deliveries to customers is called transportation management, which is under the Supply Chain umbrella. We receive payment from the customer and handle any follow-up sales-related tasks, such as the customer returning the purchased good, completing a quality inspection, and ideally returning the good to stock in our warehouse so we can sell the product to a future customer. If the product is defective, we need to identify the cause - was it a faulty component we made in-house, or was it a component purchased from one of our suppliers? This initiates follow-up actions to handle the defect and then salvage as much as we can from the product before disposing of the remaining components in a responsible way. If the product has a warranty, we move into the Service LoB to respond to claims and deliver the service guaranteed in the warranty.

SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition is also a good fit for larger customers when deployed in combination with SAP S/4HANA on premise or SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition in a two-tier ERP structure.

Sustainability and artificial intelligence capabilities are built into many of the standard business processes to enable customers to get a clear understanding of their organization's environmental impact and run deep analyses on their business data.

The SAP Fiori Launchpad makes it easy for non-developers to make small customizations through the built-in low/no-code extensibility applications, and helps end users learn how to use the new software through embedded in-context support information and tutorials.

Key Stakeholders

For the remainder of this course, "customer" refers to someone who has purchased SAP software for their organization, or someone within the organization working as part of the larger project team to support the implementation of that solution. "Partner" refers to someone working for an organization with which SAP has established a partner program to build, sell, service, or run SAP solutions. As an employee of a partner organization preparing to implement an SAP solution, you are a service partner. SAP also implements our solutions for customers, but we rely on our partner ecosystem to meet the global demand and bring specialized industry expertise to customers with unique requirements.

Key Stakeholders
In the Discover phase of the SAP Activate Methodology, the customer executive sponsor(s) have already built a business case for their organization to purchase SAP S/4HANA Cloud, worked with a sales person from a partner or SAP to complete the Digital Discovery Assessment, and made the final purchase decision. They are often in the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), or other similar roles within their organization. The customer executive sponsors will have a counterpart from the partner or SAP, depending on who is implementing the solution. Communication from the customer executive sponsors within their organization is an important part of the change management plan that will be defined later in the project.

The customer System Admin should be identified and communicated to SAP as early as possible, so we know who should be assigned the permission role of the IT Contact. This role grants administrator access to support applications and the ability to provision the systems purchased by the customer. If no one has been explicitly chosen when the SAP S/4HANA Cloud contract is signed, the signer (CTO, CIO, or similar) will be granted the IT Contact role by default. This can be changed at a later point in time.

The implementation of SAP S/4HANA Cloud begins in the Prepare phase when a partner/SAP implementation project team starts work on the project. In the Prepare phase, the priority is to get all systems necessary for the project provisioned, and provide access to these systems to the implementation project team members. A partner/SAP implementation team should be staffed with minimum one expert representing each line of business (LoB) to be implemented for the customer, a project manager, and a lead configuration expert, who will complete the majority of the business process content activation and initial setup activities in the SAP Central Business Configuration tool. Ideally, there would be two partner/SAP experts per LoB, with the number increasing proportionally based on the number of business processes that need to be implemented in each LoB. For example, Finance is one of the biggest LoBs and Professional Services is one of the smallest, so there would always be more experts in Finance than in Professional Services on projects where these two LoBs are in scope.

Additional members will be added to the customer project team, including a project manager who is the counterpart of the partner/SAP project manager, and a change management team should be established if the customer did not already purchase change management services from the partner organization. Regardless of who handles change management, someone (partner or customer) needs to be responsible for the communication and training and adoption tasks during the implementation project and after go-live. If the consumers have difficulty adopting the business processes in the new SAP S/4HANA Cloud system, it will have a very negative impact on the overall success of the project.

The most important task in the Explore phase are the Fit-to-Standard analysis workshops conducted for each line of business. Experts representing various business roles in each LoB from the customer organization are now added to the extended project team to participate in the Fit-to-Standard workshops. During the workshops, partner/SAP LoB experts demonstrate each business process chosen on the Digital Discovery Assessment from start to finish in the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Starter System. This serves several purposes:

- Teaching the customer LoB experts how end-to-end processes are navigated in SAP S/4HANA Cloud
- Giving the customer LoB experts time to carefully review each process and provide feedback if certain changes are necessary to make the process fit their needs
- Partner/SAP experts leading the workshops gather configuration values and additional requirements from the customer LoB experts, which will be used later when setting up the customer's actual systems
- Building relationships with the customer LoB experts with the goal of inviting them to complete user acceptance testing (UAT) of the same processes after they have been configured in the Realize phase. UAT is mandatory and must be completed before the implementation project can move into the Deploy phase.

Note: It's important the customer LoB experts invited to the Fit-to-Standard workshops are responsible for the day-to-day activities that are being covered in the workshops, because they will be able to provide the most detailed and accurate feedback the closer they are to the process in real life.

Additional members will likely be added to the customer's extended project team as the tasks of integration, customization, and data migration are completed by the partner/SAP implementation project team.

For integration, this is because custom integrations need the support of developers on the customer side to both support building the integration and so they know where the integrations live (ideally in SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)) and can maintain them in the future.

For customizations, partner/SAP consultants are responsible for completing in-app extensions within SAP S/4HANA Cloud using the Fiori apps designed to support extensions (e.g. custom fields, custom logic, etc.). For side-by-side extensions that live in the customer's BTP system, there are two options:

- Low/no-code extensions made with SAP Build, which is included in the GROW with SAP enablement package.
- Classical code-based extensions hosted through a different service on SAP BTP.

It's typically most cost-effective for the customer to have their own developers tackle these side-by-side extensions, although a partner/SAP resource can also be brought on the project for an additional fee.

For data migration, the partner/SAP implementation project team will need contact(s) within the customer organization who have permission to access and extract data that needs to be migrated to SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

Finally, the consumers of the solution (customer end users) need to be onboarded and trained by the change management team to ensure there is a successful transition from the old systems to the new SAP S/4HANA Cloud system in the Deploy phase.

The extended project team includes customer Line of Business (LoB) process exerts, and other supporting customer experts involved in integration and customization activities. Partner/SAP consultants will lead the LoB-specific workshops to collect configuration values, review the standard SAP Best Practices business processes with customer LoB experts, gather additional integration requirements, gather customization requirements, and other information used in the Realize phase to configure the solution. In addition, it's important to have at least one Organizational Change Management expert (customer or partner) involved in each workshop to identify the change impact for each LoB. Assessing the change impact is essential to determining the training requirements to efficiently and effectively ramp up employees / consumers of the solution (L3 stakeholders).

Roles and Responsibilities

The executive sponsors on the customer and partner/SAP project teams collectively make up the steering committee. They are responsible for overall project coordination, including critical decisions, budget, resources (employees staffed to the project), and decisions that affect the entire organization. The steering committee is also the last level of escalation, for example if a custom development is required to resolve a requirement.

The project managers on the customer and partner/SAP project teams are responsible for setting up the SAP S/4HANA Cloud implementation project in SAP Cloud ALM. Once set up, SAP Cloud ALM makes the tasks and deliverables from the SAP Activate Methodology roadmap actionable, meaning they can be assigned to the responsible project team members so that completion can be tracked. In steering committee meetings, the customer and partner/SAP project managers are responsible for delivering status updates using SAP Cloud ALM to run reports on the overall project completion.

The customer system admin (IT Contact) and partner/SAP lead configuration expert work together to get all necessary systems provisioned and permission granted to the relevant team members to access each system.

The partner/SAP line of business (LoB) configuration experts lead Fit-to-Standard workshops with the corresponding LoB experts from the customer's extended project team. The partner/SAP LoB configuration experts are responsible for documenting important information related to business processes in their LoB area of expertise with the Requirements app in SAP Cloud ALM. In the Realize phase, the documented requirements will be implemented by the partner/SAP LoB configuration experts for the following:

- Entering configuration values in SAP Central Business Configuration
- Defining business role customizations
- Building key user in-app extensions using the SAP Fiori apps in SAP S/4HANA Cloud
- Defining output management customizations
- Using the capabilities within SAP S/4HANA Cloud to customize relevant analytical apps
- Migrating data for relevant objects
- Setting up SAP Best Practice integrations for business processes that require an integration to function correctly
- Setting up and running test automates in the Test Automation Tool

Additional technical experts will likely need to be brought into either the customer or partner/SAP project teams to support integration, side-by-side extensibility in SAP Business Technology Platform, and data migration.

System Landscapes for Implementation

Landscape Overview

SAP for Me is used to trigger provisioning of the systems used during implementation, and has a variety of other self-service tools for partners and customers.

SAP Cloud Identity consists of two different services - Identity Authentication Service (IAS) and Identity Provisioning Service (IPS). Together, they provide secure access to the customer's SAP Cloud applications. This is the first system provisioned and it's typical to have two tenants (test and production).

SAP Cloud ALM is included at no cost in the Enterprise Support for cloud editions package, which is automatically included with any SAP Cloud solution. Cloud ALM runs on the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) and provides applications to designed to support project management, system operations, and manage service requests.

SAP Central Business Configuration also runs on SAP BTP and is used to activate business process content in the SAP S/4HANA Cloud systems.

SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) is a platform as a service where you can develop and host integrations, extensions, applications, along with a wide range of other functionality.

SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition Systems

The Starter System is a preconfigured system with all SAP Best Practice business processes active in addition to master data that is used by the partner implementation team to demonstrate business processes to customer line of business experts during Fit-to-Standard workshops.

The Development System is where the business processes are activated, configured, and customized. There are two tenants: Customizing (client 100) and Development (Client 80). Changes made in the development system are transported to the test system.

The Test System is the quality assurance environment used to test out configurations and changes made in the development system. After testing and confirming business processes are functioning as expected, changes are transported to the production system.

The Production System is where the customer runs their day-to-day business activities.

Note: When the Production System is provisioned, the Starter System is automatically decommissioned 30 days later. In some implementations, this can cause issues because the Stater System may still be needed for Fit-to-Standard workshops in other line of business areas or other countries. For this reason, an optional Sandbox System can be subscribed to (for an additional fee) to be used as an alternative for Fit-to-Standard workshops conducted after the Starter System has been decommissioned.

SAP for Me

SAP for Me is the one-stop digital platform for customers and partners to use a variety of self-service tools to manage their systems, solutions, support cases, and more. SAP for Me is an essential resource at the beginning of an implementation because the customer system admin granted the IT Contact permission will use the Systems & Provisioning dashboard to provision all systems required for the implementation.

SAP for Me dashboards include:

- Customer Success enables partners to manage their cloud and on premise customers with information about customer products, licenses, and orders.
- Finance & Legal enables customers to manage their SAP orders, payments, licensed products, and license consumption.
- Partner Solutions enables partners to manage, upgrade, and build partner solutions and certifications.
- Partnership enables partners to access the latest SAP PartnerEdge news, partnership details, agreements, contracts, and partnership tracks.
- Products & Portfolio enables customers to manage all cloud and on premise products in their portfolio, in addition to a view of upcoming road map innovations.
- Sales & Marketing supports partners in tracking their pipeline of sales deals and open quotes with customers.
- Services & Support helps customers and partners request support, manage support cases, search for relevant SAP Knowledge Base Articles (KBAs) and SAP Notes, and directly access tools to manage the lifecycle of products.
- Systems & Provisioning is where the customer system admin can provision their purchased SAP cloud solutions, keep track of all SAP cloud and on premise systems, view and manage remote connections, and see information on license and migration keys.
- Users & Contacts is where customers and partners can access information about important contacts within SAP and their own organization.

SAP Cloud Identity Services

SAP Cloud Identity Services run on the SAP Business Technology Platform and include both the Identity Authentication Service (IAS) and Identity Provisioning Service (IPS). Collectively, these services provide a single sign-on (SSO) experience across a customer's SAP systems and ensure that system and data access are secure.

If a customer doesn't already have SAP Cloud Identity, these systems are automatically provisioned when a customer system admin triggers the provisioning of any SAP Cloud solution they have purchased through SAP for Me.

SAP Cloud ALM

SAP Cloud ALM runs on the SAP Business Technology Platform, and is included in the Enterprise Support for cloud editions for all customers purchasing SAP cloud solutions.

There are three main components of SAP Cloud ALM used during an implementation and after go-live for SAP S/4HANA Cloud: SAP Cloud ALM for Implementation, SAP Cloud ALM for Operations, and SAP Cloud ALM for Service.

SAP Cloud ALM for Implementation provides applications to manage the entire implementation following the SAP Activate Methodology. SAP Cloud ALM turns the tasks and deliverables that are documented in the methodology into actionable items that can be assigned to the team member(s) responsible for completing each task.

SAP Cloud ALM for Operations provides applications targeted to the customer's IT support team for maintaining and monitoring their SAP system landscapes. The operations apps have visibility into any system set up as a managed landscape, and therefore provide a one-stop shop for monitoring the health of a customer's entire landscape of integrated systems.

SAP Cloud ALM for Service provides applications designed to make the end-to-end service delivery process between SAP and customers as transparent as possible.

SAP Central Business Configuration

SAP Central Business Configuration is the tool used to activate business process content in different local versions (countries/regions), define core finance settings that affect the entire system (e.g. group currency and fiscal year variant), build the customer's organizational structure, and enter configuration values specific to the active business processes.

SAP Central Business Configuration runs on the SAP Business Technology Platform and is connected to a customer's SAP S/4HANA Cloud starter and development system tenants. In the future, the goal is for SAP Central Business Configuration to be used to configure and deploy content across multiple SAP Cloud solutions, but at this point in time, it exclusively supports SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.

SAP Central Business Configuration provides guidance throughout the sequence of activities completed to activate business processes in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. There is a central overview page where you can see activities that have been completed, and those than need to be completed.

When a release upgrade occurs, new business processes become available and a customer may want to turn on one or more new processes. Whether this occurs in the middle of an implementation or after go-live, customers and partners use SAP Central Business Configuration to move the workspace to the phase where business processes can be selected, select the relevant processes, and move forward through the guided activities to ensure additional follow-up tasks related to the activation of new processes are completed.

SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)

In the context of an SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition implementation, SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) is the engine powering many applications including SAP Cloud ALM, SAP Cloud Identity Services, and SAP Central Business Configuration. It's also where the SAP standard integrations have been developed and run, and where customers can access the additional low/no-code tools included in their GROW with SAP enablement package to build extensions, automate processes and create engaging business sites with SAP Build Apps, SAP Build Process Automation, and SAP Build Work Zone.

3-System Landscape (3SL) for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition

In August 2022 (release 2208), the 3-system landscape (3SL) became available. The 2-system landscape (2SL) included a Quality system, where customizations were both created and tested, and a Production system. 3SL includes a Development system, Test system (previously named, Quality), and Production system. This enables developers to build more complex on-stack extensions using stable SAP objects in the development tenant (client 80) of the development system, and separates testing activities into a dedicated test system.

SAP S/4HANA Cloud Development System

Within a system, there can be one or more client tenants with different purposes. A client is an organizational unit in the system with specific user master records and authorizations. The SAP S/4HANA Cloud starter and development systems have two client tenants:

- Development tenant / client 080 is for developer extensibility in the SAP S/4HANA Cloud ABAP environment, where developers have full ABAP development tool access to released SAP S/4HANA Cloud business objects and extension points. The development tenant is client-independent, meaning development objects built here can be accessed from the customizing tenant if permission is granted.

- Customizing tenant / client 100 is the main workspace, used for business process configuration and key user extensibility with the SAP Fiori extensibility apps. The customizing tenant is client-dependent, meaning configurations or extensions made here can only be accessed within the customizing tenant.

Release Upgrade Schedule

SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition has two major releases per year in February and August. New business processes, enhancements to existing processes, and other technical features are delivered during a major release. SAP automatically pushes the release enhancements and features to customer systems on the dates defined in the Upgrade & Maintenance schedule.

Enhancements to existing processes will only be applied to customer systems where those processes are already activated. This is relevant for the other technical features too - if the feature is not applicable for the customer's active business processes, the feature would not be applied to that customer's system. Activating a brand new business process is completely up to the customer's discretion, and can be done in SAP Central Business Configuration if they choose to do so.

During the six months between releases, smaller non-disruptive features also become available and a customer may choose whether or not to activate them in their own system. If these smaller non-disruptive features are not activated during the six month period in which they are delivered, they will automatically be activated and available to use after the next major release occurs in February or August.

The code used to identify a release includes the last two digits of the release year, the numerical month (02 or 08), and a reference to each subsequent feature delivery as they are rolled out. For example, if the past major release was August in the year 2024 and two feature deliveries have been published since then, the release code is 2408.2.

Release Upgrade Process Flow

Software Upgrade in Test System: Customers are notified by email 6 weeks before an upgrade occurs. On the defined release schedule, the customer's SAP S/4HANA Cloud test system will be upgraded to the latest software release by SAP.

Software Upgrade in Development and Production Systems: Three weeks after the software upgrade is pushed to the test system, SAP upgrades the development and production systems to the latest software release.

Content Upgrade in SAP Central Business Configuration & Development System: The content upgrade follows the software upgrade. Changes to business process content are released first in SAP Central Business Configuration, where they are recorded in a transport request and automatically exported to a customer's development system tenants and forwarded to the test system.

Release Assessment Scope Dependency (RASD) Tool: The Release Assessment Scope Dependency (RASD) is provided as a free tool for all SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition customers to give a clear understanding of exactly how a release will affect the content deployed in their unique system. The RASD compares the What's New release upgrade information against a customer's actual landscape to provide the "day 1 impact" of a release.

DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION AND CONFIGURATION GUIDE

Key Stakeholders in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Implementation

For SAP S/4HANA Cloud implementations, "customer" refers to someone who has purchased SAP software for their organization, or someone within the organization working as part of the larger project team to support the implementation. "Partner" refers to someone working for an organization with which SAP has established a partner program to build, sell, service, or run SAP solutions.

In the Discover phase of the SAP Activate Methodology, the customer executive sponsor(s) have already built a business case for their organization to purchase SAP S/4HANA Cloud, worked with a sales person from a partner or SAP to complete the Digital Discovery Assessment, and made the final purchase decision. They are often in the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), or other similar roles within their organization.

The customer System Admin should be identified and communicated to SAP as early as possible, so we know who should be assigned the permission role of the IT Contact. This role grants administrator access to support applications and the ability to provision the systems purchased by the customer.

Implementation Team Structure:
- Customer executive sponsors (CTO, CIO level)
- Customer System Admin (IT Contact)
- Partner/SAP implementation project team
- Customer project manager
- Partner/SAP project manager
- Lead configuration expert
- Line of Business (LoB) configuration experts
- Change management team
- Customer LoB experts for Fit-to-Standard workshops

Fit-to-Standard Analysis Workshops

The most important task in the Explore phase are the Fit-to-Standard analysis workshops conducted for each line of business. During these workshops, partner/SAP LoB experts demonstrate each business process chosen on the Digital Discovery Assessment from start to finish in the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Starter System.

Purposes of Fit-to-Standard workshops:
1. Teaching customer LoB experts how end-to-end processes are navigated in SAP S/4HANA Cloud
2. Giving customer LoB experts time to carefully review each process and provide feedback
3. Gathering configuration values and additional requirements from customer LoB experts
4. Building relationships with customer LoB experts for future user acceptance testing (UAT)

Business Driven Configuration Questionnaires (BDCQ)

The Business Driven Configuration Questionnaires are used by partner LoB configuration experts to gather configuration values that will be entered in SAP Central Business Configuration. There are two levels:
- Level 2 (L2) values gathered in the Prepare phase prior to workshops
- Level 3 (L3) values gathered during Fit-to-Standard workshops

System Provisioning and User Management

SAP for Me is used to trigger provisioning of systems during implementation. The customer IT Contact triggers provisioning of the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Landscape systems:
- SAP Cloud Identity (if customer doesn't already have an account)
- SAP Cloud ALM
- SAP Central Business Configuration
- SAP S/4HANA Cloud Starter System (both customizing and development tenants)

SAP Cloud Identity Services include:
- Identity Authentication Service (IAS)
- Identity Provisioning Service (IPS)
These provide single sign-on (SSO) experience across customer's SAP systems.

User Creation and Authorization

Business users can be assigned one or more business roles. A business role includes business catalogs that grant access to data and/or applications. Important concepts:

Business Role Structure:
- Business catalogs grant access to applications
- Restrictions can limit scope of access
- Launchpad spaces define how apps display
- Employee role provides access to self-service applications

Price Categories for Business Roles:
- Development support
- Self-service (1 FUE = 30 self-service users)
- Core (1 FUE = 5 core users)
- Advanced (1 FUE = 1 advanced user)
- Developer (1 FUE = 0.50 developer access)

SAP Fiori Launchpad

SAP Fiori is a design language providing role-based, adaptive, simple, coherent, and delightful user experience. The SAP Fiori Launchpad is the single entry point to all apps permissioned to a user.

Key Components:
- My Home: Personalized landing page
- Spaces and Pages: Containers for organizing apps
- Embedded Help: In-context support and tutorials
- SAP Joule: Generative AI digital assistant

Extensibility in SAP S/4HANA Cloud

Extensibility covers adaptations to standard business software beyond business configuration capabilities.

In-App Extensibility:
